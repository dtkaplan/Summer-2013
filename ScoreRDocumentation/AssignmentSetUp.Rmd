Setting up an assignment
========================================================

```{r include=FALSE}
require(WriteScoreR)
```


```{r}
require(WriteScoreR)
newScorerSet("set-up-DTK-2013-05-27")
```

How to set up an assignment

### Just a couple of questions to illustrate scoring

```{r}
piQuestion = selectSet(name="piValue",totalPts=4,
                       "2.71727"=FALSE,"3.14159"=TRUE,
                       "6.28318"=FALSE)
```

* Which is closest to $\pi$? `r I(piQuestion)`

* Pick an even number out of this set:  `r I(selectNumber(choices=c(3,5,6,7,8,9),correct=c(6,8),name="evens",totalPts=2))`

```{r eval=FALSE}
I(selectNumber(choices=c(3,5,6,7,8,9),correct=c(6,8),name="evens",totalPts=2))
```

### To Do

* Provide different formats, not just the dropdown menu.

`r I(closeProblem())`
