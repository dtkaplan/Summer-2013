By hand, calculate the mean, the range, the variance, and the standard
deviation of each of the following sets of numbers:

  ( A ) $1, 0, -1$    
  ( B ) $1, 3$    
  ( C ) $1, 2, 3$.    
  
```{r include=FALSE}
range=selectSet(name="spread", totalPts=1, "A"=FALSE, "B"=FALSE, "C"=FALSE, "No way to know"=FALSE, "All the same"=TRUE)
```
* Which of the 3 sets of numbers --- A, B, or C --- is the most spread out according to the range? `r I(range)`

```{r include=FALSE}
range2=selectSet(name="StdDev", totalPts=1, "A"=FALSE, "B"=TRUE, "C"=FALSE, "No way to know"=FALSE, "All the same"=FALSE)
```
* Which of the 3 sets of numbers  --- A, B, or C --- is the most spread out according to the standard deviation? `r I(range2)`

`r I(endProblem())`
