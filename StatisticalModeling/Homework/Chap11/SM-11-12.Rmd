Experience shows that the number of cars entering a park on a summer's day is approximately normally distributed with mean 200 and variance 900.  Find the probability that the number of cars entering the park is less than 195. 

```{r include=FALSE}
cars=selectSet(name="type", totalPts=1, "percentile"=TRUE, "quantile"=FALSE)
```
* Which type of calculation is this? `r I(cars)`

```{r include=FALSE}
cars2=selectNumber(choices=c(0.3125,0.4338,0.4885,0.5237,0.6814,0.7163), correct=c(0.4338), totalPts=1, name="calculation")
```
* Do the calculation with the given parameters.  (Watch out! Look carefully
at the parameters and make sure they are in a standard form.) `r I(cars2)`

`r I(closeProblem())`
