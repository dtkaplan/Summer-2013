Aspirin acts as a blood thinner, that is, it suppresses coagulation of blood.  Suppressed coagulation of blood increases the chances of bleeding.

Suppose that smoking gives people a headache, leading them to take aspirin.   Also suppose that smoking increases the chances of bleeding.

Draw a diagram of a hypothetical causal network that corresponds to this situation.  Use as nodes "Aspirin", "Coagulation", "Bleeding", and "Smoking.

`r I(textItem(name="diagram", totalPts=2, rows=4))`

Suppose you want to study the way that aspirin causally affects bleeding.  Do you want to include or exclude smoking as a covariate?

`r I(textItem(name="smoking", totalPts=2, rows=2))`

`r I(endProblem())`
