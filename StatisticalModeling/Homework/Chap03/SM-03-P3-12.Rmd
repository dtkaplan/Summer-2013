Intro to Statistical Modeling Ch. 3 Prob. 3.12
========================================================
```{r include=FALSE}
require(mosaic)
require(ScoreR)
startProblem("SM-3-P12-SD")
```

A standard deviation contest.  For (a) and (b) below, you can choose
numbers from the set $0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8$, and $9$.  Repeats are
allowed.

```{r include=FALSE}
contest=selectSet(name="largestdev", totalPts=1, "$0,3,6,9$"=FALSE, "$0,0,0,9$"=FALSE, "$0,0,9,9$"=TRUE, "$0,9,9,9$"=FALSE)
```
* Which list of 4 numbers has the largest standard
  deviation such a list can possibly have? `r I(contest)`
  
```{r include=FALSE}
contest2=selectSet(name="smallestdev", totalPts=1, "$0,3,6,9$"=FALSE, "$0,1,2,3$"=FALSE, "$5,5,6,6$"=FALSE, "$9,9,9,9$"=TRUE)
```
* Which list of 4 numbers has the smallest standard
  deviation such a list can possibly have? `r I(contest2)`


`r I(endProblem())`
