*Time Magazine* reported the results of a poll of people's opinions about the U.S. economy in July 2008.  The results are summarized in the graph.


![Opinions About the Economy](time-poll-july-2008.png)

[Source: *Time*, July 28, 2008, p. 41]


The variables depicted in the graph are:

* *Pessimism*, as indicated by agreeing with the statement that
the U.S. was a better place to live in the 1990s and will continue to
decline. 
* *Ethnicity*, with three levels: White, African American, Hispanic.
* *Income*, with five levels.
* *Age*, with four levels.

```{r include=FALSE}
statements=selectSet(name="PessimismIncome", totalPts=1, "Pessimism declines as incomes get higher"=TRUE, " Pessimism increases as incomes get higher"=FALSE, "Pessimism is unrelated to income"=FALSE) 
```
Judging from the information in the graph, which of these statements
best describes the model *pessimism* ~ *income*? `r I(statements)`

```{r include=FALSE}
statements2=selectSet(name="PessimismAge", totalPts=1, "Pessimism is highest in the 18-29 age group."=TRUE, "Pessimism is highest in the 64 and older group."=FALSE, "Pessimism is lowest among whites."=FALSE, "Pessimism is unrelated to age."=FALSE)
```

Again, judging from the information in the graph, which of these
statements best describes the model *pessimism* ~ *age*? `r I(statements2)`


Poll results such as this are almost always reported using just one
explanatory variable at a time, as in this graphic.  However, it can
be more informative to know the effect of one variable while *adjusting for* other variables.  For example, in looking at the
connection between *pessimism* and *age*, it would be useful to
be able to untangle the influence of *income*.

<aside>

Imagine that the poll were reported in terms of a model 
*pessimism* ~ *age* + *income*. Keep in mind
that there is a strong correlation between *age* and *income*, with
people in the 18-29 age group typically having smaller incomes than
people in older age groups.

Which of the following is true about the *age* coefficients from such a model?
```{r include=FALSE}
f=newMC(totalPts=1, name="age.model")
```
`r I(f(FALSE))` They would be exactly the same as in the *pessimism* ~ *age*?     
`r I(f(TRUE))` They would display the relationship between *pessimism* and *age* adjusting for *income*.     
`r I(f(FALSE))` They would display the relationship between *pessimism* and *income* adjusting for *age*.
```{r include=FALSE, results='hide'}
I(f(finish=TRUE))
```

How do you think the conclusions suggested by the poll might be different if the results were presented in terms of the model *pessimism* ~ *age* + *income* rather than the two separate models *pessimism* ~ *age* and *pessimism* ~ *income*?      
`r I(textItem(name="conclusions", totalPts=2, rows=4))`

<aside>
ANSWER:
Taking into account that younger people tend to have lower incomes, and that lower income people tend to be more pessimistic, it is likely that the model *pessimism* ~ *age* + *income* would show a different relationship between *pessimism* and *age* than the model *pessimism* ~ *age*.  For example,
Simpson's paradox might apply and it could be that, when adjusting for income, younger people are *less* pessimistic than older people.

Unfortunately, it's not possible to reconstruct the multi-variable
models from the single-variable summaries that are typical of polls.
It would be helpful if results were presented after adjusting for the
other variables involved.
