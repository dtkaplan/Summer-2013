A perennial problem when writing scientific reports is figuring out
how many significant digits to report.  It's na\"ive to 
copy all the digits from one's calculator or computer
output; the data generally do not justify such
precision. 

Once you have a confidence interval, however, you do not need to guess
how many significant digits are appropriate.  The standard error
provides good guidance.  Here is a rule of thumb: keep two significant
digits of the margin of error and round the point estimate to the same
precision.  

For example, suppose you have a confidence interval of $1.7862 \pm
0.3624$ with 95% confidence.  Keeping the first two significant
digits of the margin of error gives $0.36$.  We'll keep the point
estimate to the same number of digits, giving altogether $1.79 \pm
0.36$.

Another example: suppose the confidence interval is $6548.23 \pm
1321$.  Keeping the first two digits of the margin of error gives
$1300$, with a corresponding margin of error of $6500 \pm 1300$.

* Suppose the computer output is $0.03234232 \pm 0.01837232$.

```{r include=FALSE} 
f=newMC(totalPts=1)
```


  * Using this rule of thumb, what should you report in as the
confidence interval?      
  `r I(f(FALSE))` $0.3234 &plusmn 0.01837$     
  `r I(f(FALSE))` $0.3234 &plusmn 0.0183$     
  `r I(f(FALSE))` $0.0323 &plusmn 0.0184$    
  `r I(f(FALSE))` $0.0323 &plusmn 0.018$     
  `r I(f(TRUE))` $0.032 &plusmn 0.018$     
  `r I(f(FALSE))` $0.032 &plusmn 0.01$     
  `r I(f(FALSE))` $0.03 &plusmn 0.01$     


* Now suppose the computer output were $99.63742573 \pm 1.48924367$.

```{r include=FALSE}
g=newMC(totalPts=1)
```



  * What should you report as the confidence interval?     
  `r I(g(FALSE))` $100 &plusmn 1$     
  `r I(g(FALSE))` $99 &plusmn 1.5$     
  `r I(g(TRUE))` $99.6 &plusmn 1.5$     
  `r I(g(FALSE))` $99.64 &plusmn 1.49$     
  `r I(g(FALSE))` $99.647 &plusmn 1.489$
