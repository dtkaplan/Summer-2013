Intro to Statistical Modeling Ch.1 Prob. 1.12
========================================================
```{r include=FALSE}
require(mosaic)
require(WriteScoreR)
newScorerSet("SM-AC1-02-SD")
```

The following statement gives a result that some people are surprised by:     
<code> >10e3 == 1000          
[1] FALSE</code>     

Explain why the result was FALSE rather than TRUE.

```{r include=FALSE}
f= newMC(totalPts=1)
```

`r I(f(FALSE))`10e3 is 100, not 1000     
`r I(f(TRUE))`10e3 is 10000, not 1000     
`r I(f(FALSE))`10e3 is not a valid number     
`r I(f(FALSE))`It should be true; there's a bug in the software.     

```{r results="hide", include=FALSE}
I(f(finish=TRUE))
```

<aside> ANSWER: The computer returns <code>FALSE</code> because the quantities being compared with <code>==</code> are not equal.  <code>10e3</code> is ten-thousand in scientific notation.  It's <code>1e3</code> that is one-thousand.

`r I(closeProblem())`
