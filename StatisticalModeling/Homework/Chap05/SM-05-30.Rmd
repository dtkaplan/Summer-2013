After a month's hard work in the laboratory, you have measured a
growth hormone from each of 40 plants and computed a confidence interval on
the grand mean hormone concentration of $36 \pm 8$ ng/ml.  Your advisor asks you
to collect more samples until the margin of error is $4$ ng/ml.
Assuming the typical $1/\sqrt{n}$ relationship between the number of cases in the sample and the size of the margin of error, how many plants, including
the 40 you have already processed, will you need to measure? `r I(measure)`

`r I(closeProblem())`
