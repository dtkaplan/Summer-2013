A manufacturer of electrical fiber optic cables produces spools that are 50,000 feet long.  In the production process, flaws are introduced randomly.  A study of the flaws indicates that, on average, there is 1 flaw per 10000 feet.

```{r include=FALSE}
prob1=selectSet(name="distrib", totalPts=1, "normal"=FALSE, "uniform"=FALSE, "binomial"=FALSE, "exponential"=FALSE, "poisson"=TRUE)
```
* Which probability distribution describes the situation of how many flaws there will be in a spool of cable. `r I(prob1)`

* What's the probability that a 50,000 foot-long cable has 3 or fewer flaws?  (Enter your answer to 3 decimal places, e.g., 0.456.) `r I(textItem(name="probability", totalPts=2, rows=1))`
