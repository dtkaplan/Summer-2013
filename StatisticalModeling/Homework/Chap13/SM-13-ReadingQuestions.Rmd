* What is a "null hypothesis?"  Why does it play a special role in hypothesis testing? 

 `r I(textItem(name="null", totalPts=2, rows=3))`

* Why is it good to have a hypothesis test with a low "significance level?" 

 `r I(textItem(name="significance", totalPts=2, rows=3))`

* Why is it good to have a hypothesis test with a high "power?"

 `r I(textItem(name="power", totalPts=2, rows=3))`

* What is a p-value? 

 `r I(textItem(name="p-value", totalPts=2, rows=3))`

* Why are there two kinds of potential errors in hypothesis testing, Type I and Type II? 

 `r I(textItem(name="errors", totalPts=2, rows=3))`

`r I(endProblem())`
