What can be said about the ages of a male and a female with the same
maximum heart rate?

`r I(f(FALSE))` The male will be older by 6 years.     
`r I(f(TRUE))` The male will be younger by 6 years.     
`r I(f(FALSE))` It depends on the heart rate.      

```{r results="hide", include=FALSE}
I(f(finish=TRUE))
```

`r I(closeProblem())`
