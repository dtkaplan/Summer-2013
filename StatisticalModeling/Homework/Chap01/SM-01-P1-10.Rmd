Intro to Statistical Modeling Ch.1 Prob. 1.10
========================================================
```{r include=FALSE}
require(mosaic)
require(ScoreR)
startProblem("SM-01-P1-10-SD")
```

Try the following command:     
<code>seq(1,5, by=.5, length=2)
</code>

Why do you think the computer responded the way it did?

`r I(textItem(name="response", rows=4, totalPts=2))`

<aside>
The command specifies **both** of the arguments <code>by</code> and
<code>length</code>.  These arguments are inconsistent with one another:
they would result in different sequences.
The person who wrote the <code>seq</code> software was polite enough to
warn you of such situations so that you can fix them.

`r I(endProblem())`
