The plot shows two different displays of density.  The displays might
be from the same distribution or two different distributions.


![plot](B103-2-exp.png)


```{r include=FALSE}
density=selectSet(name="display", totalPts=1, "Density and cumulative"=FALSE, "Rug and cumulative"=TRUE, "Cumulative and box plot"=FALSE, "Density and rug plot"=FALSE, "Rug and box plot"=FALSE)
```
( a ) What are the two displays? `r I(density)`

<aside>
ANSWER: The rug plot is the small ticks on the horizontal axis.  The other
distribution has a shape that increases steadily --- never decreasing --- starting from 0 on
the left and going to 1 on the right.  That's the shape of a
cumulative distribution.

```{r include=FALSE}
density2=selectSet(name="distrib", totalPts=1, "TRUE"=TRUE, "FALSE"=FALSE)
```
( b ) The two displays show the same distribution. `r I(density2)` 

( c ) Describe briefly any sign of mismatch or what features convince you
that the two displays are equivalent.     
`r I(textItem(name="sign", totalPts=1, rows=4))`

`r I(endProblem())`
