```{r include=FALSE}
require(WriteScoreR)
newScorerSet("AC-2013-06-06-SD")
require(mosaic)
```

```{r include = FALSE}
f = newMC(totalPts=1)
```

Which is an equation for the line that passes through points $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$?      
`r I(f(TRUE))` $y = 0 + 1x$      
`r I(f(FALSE))` $y = 1 + 0x$   
`r I(f(FALSE))` $y = 1 + 1x$     
`r I(f(FALSE))` $y = 1 + 2x$     

```{r results = "hide", include=FALSE}
I(f(finish=TRUE))
```
