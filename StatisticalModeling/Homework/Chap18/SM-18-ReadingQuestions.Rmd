* Is the point of a controlled experiment to create variability or to avoid variability? 

 `r I(textItem(name="controlled", totalPts=2, rows=3))`

* What is an experimental variable?  In what ways is it the same and in what ways different from an explanatory variable? 

 `r I(textItem(name="experimental", totalPts=2, rows=3))`

* What is the purpose of randomization in conducting an experiment?  What gets randomized? 

 `r I(textItem(name="randomization", totalPts=2, rows=3))`

* Why might blocking be preferred to randomization? 

 `r I(textItem(name="blocking", totalPts=2, rows=3))`

* What is the point of matched sampling and instrumental variables? 

 `r I(textItem(name="matching", totalPts=2, rows=3))`

`r I(endProblem())`
