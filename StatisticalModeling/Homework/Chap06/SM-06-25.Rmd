The drawings show some data involving three variables: 
* D --- a quantitative variable
* A --- a quantitative variable
* G --- a categorical variable with two levels: S & K

Sketch the graph on a piece of paper.  Over that sketch, draw a function
that shows the pattern of
the fitted model values for each of the following models:

* *D ~ A+G*

<aside>
ANSWER:     
![Answer1](s2007-9-fig-ans1.png)

There are two linear components --- one for each level of G.  But, since there is no interaction term, the lines must have the same slope. 
</aside>

* *D ~ A-1*

<aside>
ANSWER:     
![Answer2](s2007-9-fig-ans3.png)

The exclusion of the intercept term forces the line to go through the origin.
</aside>

* *D ~ A*

<aside>
ANSWER:     
![Answer3](s2007-9-fig-ans5.png)

A simple straight-line graph.
</aside>

* *D ~ A * G*

<aside>
ANSWER:      
![Answer4](s2007-9-fig-ans2.png)

By including an interaction term between A and G, the lines for each group can have different slopes.
</aside>

* *D ~ 1*

<aside>
ANSWER:     
![Answer5](s2007-9-fig-ans4.png)

This is the all-cases-the-same model.  Since model doesn't depend on A or G at all, the graph is flat.
</aside>

* *D ~ poly(A,2)*

<aside>
ANSWER:     
![Answer6](s2007-9-fig-ans6.png)

A second-order polynomial has a parabolic shape.  The fitted parameters set the location of the peak and the orientation ("bowl" or "mountain").
</aside>


Example: *D ~ G*.
