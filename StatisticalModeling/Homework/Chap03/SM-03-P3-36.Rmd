Elevators typically have a close-door button.  Some people claim that
this button has no mechanical function; it's there just to give
impatient people some sense of control over the elevator.  

Design and conduct an experiment to test whether the button does cause
the elevator door to close.  Pick an elevator with such a button and
record some details about the elevator itself: place installed, year
installed, model number, etc.  

Describe your experiment along with the measurements you made and your
conclusions.  You may want to do the experiment in small teams and use
a stopwatch in order to make accurate measurements.  Presumably, you
will want to measure the time between when the button is pressed and
when the door closes, but you might want to measure other quantities
as well, for instance the time from when the door first opened to when
you press the button.  

Store the data from your experiment in a spreadsheet in Google Docs.
Set the permissions for the spreadsheet so that anyone with the link
can read your data.  Make sure to **paste the link** into the
textbox so that your data can be accessed.

Please don't inconvenience other elevator users with the experiment.
