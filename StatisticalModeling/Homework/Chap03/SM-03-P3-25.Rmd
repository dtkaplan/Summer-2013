Use the Internet to find "normal" ranges for some measurements used
in clinical medicine.  Pick one of the following or choose one of
particular interest to you: blood pressure (systolic, diastolic,
pulse), hematocrit, blood sodium and potassium levels, HDL and LDL
cholesterol, white blood cell counts, clotting times, blood sugar
levels, vital respiratory capacity, urine production, and so on.  In addition to the normal range, find out what
"normal" means, e.g., a 95% coverage interval on the population or
a range inconsistent with proper physiological function.  You may find
out that there are differing views of what "normal" means --- try to
indicate the range of such views.  You may also find out that
"normal" ranges can be different depending on age, sex, and other
demographic variables.
