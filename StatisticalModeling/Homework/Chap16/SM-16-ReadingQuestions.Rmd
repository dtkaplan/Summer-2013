* What's the difference between a "link value" and a "probability value" in a logistic regression model? How are they related to one another? 

 `r I(textItem(name="link", totalPts=2, rows=3))`

* How does the logistic function serve to keep the fitted probability values always within the range 0 to 1?

 `r I(textItem(name="logistic", totalPts=2, rows=3))`

* What is maximum likelihood and how is it used as a criterion to fit a model? 

 `r I(textItem(name="likelihood", totalPts=2, rows=3))`

`r I(endProblem())`
