Economists measure the inflation rate as a percent change in price per year.
Unemployment is measured as the fraction (percentage) of those who want to work who are seeking jobs.

According to economists, in the short run --- say, from one year to another --- there is a relationship between inflation and unemployment: all other things being equal, as unemployment goes up, inflation should go down.  (The relationship is called the "Phillips curve," but you don't need to know that or anything technical about economics to do this question.)

```{r include=FALSE}
econ=selectSet(name="unemployment", totalPts=1, "positive"=FALSE, "zero"=FALSE, "negative"=TRUE)
```
If this is true, in the model *Inflation* ~ *Unemployment*, what should be the sign of the coefficient on *Unemployment*? `r I(econ)`


But despite the short term relationship, economists claim that in the long run --- over decades --- unemployment and inflation should be unrelated.  

```{r include=FALSE}
econ2=selectSet(name="unemployment2", totalPts=1, "positive"=FALSE, "zero"=TRUE, "negative"=FALSE)
```
If this is true, in the model *Inflation* ~ *Unemployment*, what should be the sign of the coefficient on *Unemployment*? `r I(econ2)`


The point of this exercise is to figure out how to arrange a model so that you can study the short-term behavior of the relationship, or so that you can study the long term relationship.

For your reference, here is a graph showing a scatter plot of inflation and unemployment rates over about 30 years in the US.  Each point shows the inflation and unemployment rates during one quarter of a year.  The plotting symbol indicates which of three decade-long periods the point falls into.

The relationship between inflation and unemployment seems to be different from one decade to another --- that's the short term. 

```{r include=FALSE}
econ3=selectSet(name="decade", totalPts=1, "A"=TRUE, "B"=FALSE, "C"=FALSE, "none"=FALSE, "all"=FALSE)
```
Which decade seems to violate the economists' Phillips Curve short-term
relationship? `r I(econ3)`


Using the modeling language, express these different possible relationships between the variables *Inflation*, *Unemployment*, and *Decade*, where the variable *Decade* is a categorical variable with the three different levels shown in the legend for the graph. 

```{r include=FALSE}
f=newMC(totalPts=1, name="inflation.unemployment")
```
* Inflation depends on Unemployment in a way that doesn't change over
time.     
`r I(f(FALSE))` *Inflation* ~ *Decade*     
`r I(f(TRUE))` *Inflation* ~ *Unemployment*     
`r I(f(FALSE))` *Inflation* ~ *Unemployment* + *Decade*     
`r I(f(FALSE))` *Inflation* ~ *Unemployment* $\star$ *Decade*      
`r I(f(finish=TRUE))`

```{r include=FALSE}
g=newMC(totalPts=1, name="inflation.decade")
```
* Inflation changes with the decade, but doesn't depend on Unemployment.     
`r I(g(TRUE))` *Inflation* ~ *Decade*     
`r I(g(FALSE))` *Inflation* ~ *Unemployment*     
`r I(g(FALSE))` *Inflation* ~ *Unemployment* + *Decade*     
`r I(g(FALSE))` * Inflation* ~ *Unemployment* $\star$ *Decade*     
`r I(g(finish=TRUE))`

```{r include=FALSE}
h=newMC(totalPts=1, name="inflation.unemployment2")
```
* Inflation depends on Unemployment in the same way every decade, but each decade introduces a new background inflation rate independent of Unemployment.     
`r I(h(FALSE))` *Inflation* ~ *Decade*     
`r I(h(FALSE))` *Inflation* ~ *Unemployment*     
`r I(h(TRUE))` *Inflation* ~ *Unemployment* + *Decade*     
`r I(h(FALSE))` *Inflation* ~ *Unemployment* $\star$ *Decade*    
`r I(h(finish=TRUE))`

```{r include=FALSE}
j=newMC(totalPts=1, name="inflation.unemployment.decade")
```
* Inflation depends on Unemployment in a way that differs from decade to decade.     
`r I(j(FALSE))` *Inflation* ~ *Decade*     
`r I(j(FALSE))` *Inflation* ~ *Unemployment*     
`r I(j(FALSE))` *Inflation* ~ *Unemployment* + *Decade*     
`r I(j(TRUE))` *Inflation* ~ *Unemployment* $\star$ *Decade*         
`r I(j(finish=TRUE))`

Whether a model examines the short-term or the long-term behavior is analogous to whether a partial change or a total change is being considered.

```{r include=FALSE}
k=newMC(totalPts=1, name="longterm")
```
* Suppose you wanted to study the long-term relationship  between inflation and unemployment.  Which of these is appropriate?     
`r I(k(FALSE))` Hold *Decade* constant. (Partial change)      
`r I(k(TRUE))` Let *Decade* vary as it will. (Total change)     
`r I(k(finish=TRUE))`

```{r include=FALSE}
m=newMC(totalPts=1, name="shortTerm")
```
* Now suppose you want to study the short-term relationship.  Which of
these is appropriate?     
`r I(m(TRUE))` Hold *Decade* constant. (Partial change)     
`r I(m(FALSE))` Let *Decade* vary as it will. (Total change)     
`r I(m(finish=TRUE))`

`r I(endProblem())`
