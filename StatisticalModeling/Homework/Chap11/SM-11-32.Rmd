Intro to Statistical Modeling Ch. 11 Prob. 32
========================================================
```{r include=FALSE}
require(mosaic)
require(ScoreR)
startProblem("SM-11-32-SD")
```

A student is asked to calculate the probability that $x=3.5$ when $x$ is chosen from a normal distribution with the following parameters: mean=3, sd=5.  To calculate the answer, he uses this command:    

<code>
\> dnorm(3.5, mean=3, sd=5)    
[1] 0.0794
</code> 

```{r include=FALSE}
command=selectSet(name="incorrect", totalPts=1, "He should have used pnorm"=FALSE, "The parameters are wrong"=FALSE, "The answer is zero since the variable x is continuous"=TRUE, "He should have used qnorm"=FALSE)
```
This is not right.  Why not? `r I(command)`

`r I(endProblem())`
