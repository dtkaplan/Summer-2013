* What are the two major different kinds of variables?    
  `r I(textItem(rows=3, totalPts=2, name="variables"))`

* How are variables and cases arranged in a data frame?     
  `r I(textItem(rows=3, totalPts=2, name="arrangement"))`

* How is the relationship between these things: population,
  sampling frame, sample, census?     
  `r I(textItem(rows=3, totalPts=2, name="relationship"))`

* What's the difference between a longitudinal and cross-sectional
  sample?    
  `r I(textItem(rows=3, totalPts=2, name="difference"))`

* Describe some types of sampling that lead to the sample potentially being unrepresentative of the population?    
  `r I(textItem(rows=3, totalPts=2, name="unrepresentative"))`
