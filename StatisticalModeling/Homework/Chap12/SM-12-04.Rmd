```{r include=FALSE}
require(mosaic)
require(ScoreR)
startProblem("SM-12-4-SD")
```

```{r include=FALSE}
interval=selectSet(name="M", totalPts=1, "It doesn't."=FALSE, "It increases as C increases."=TRUE, "It decreases as C increases."=FALSE)
```
A confidence interval is often written as a point estimate plus or minus a margin of error: $P \pm M$ with $C$ percent confidence. How does the size of the margin of error $M$ depend on the confidence level $C$? `r I(interval)`

`r I(endProblem())`
