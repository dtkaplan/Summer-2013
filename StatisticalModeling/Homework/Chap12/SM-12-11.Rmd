What's wrong with the following statement written by a student on an exam? 

> The larger the number of cases examined and taken into account, the more likely your estimation will be accurate.  Having more cases decreases your risk
of having a bias and increases the probability that your sample accurately represents the real world.

```{r include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
I(textItem(name="incorrect", totalPts=2, rows=3))
```
`r I(textItem(name="incorrect", totalPts=2, rows=3))`

`r I(closeProblem())`
